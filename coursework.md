    * brief group presentation and demo
  * final demo
    * presentation and live demo
  * final report
    * clearly detail design and development process
    * outline testing, prototypes etc
    * explain what does and does not work in your final app
    * detail concepts and ideas for further development of this mobile application

  * help develop course project
  * test course knowledge at each stage
  * get feedback on project work
* discussions
  * sample mobile applications, games, services...
  * design topics, UI and UX concepts
* extras
  * code and application reviews
  * various other assessments
  * peer review of demos

<a id="assessment2"></a>

##### 2. project outline & mockup (15%)

* begin outline and design of a mobile application

    * **NOT** a responsive website viewed on a mobile device
  * builds upon examples, technology outlined during first part of semester
  * purpose, scope &c. is group's choice
  * chosen topic requires approval
  * presentation should include mockup designs and concepts

**n.b.** project outline assessment will include the following:

* brief presentation or demonstration of current project work
  * ~ 5 to 10 minutes per group
  * analysis of work conducted so far
  * presentation and demonstration
    * outline current state of mobile app concept and design
    * show prototypes and designs

<a id="assessment3"></a>

##### 3. DEV week assessment (25%)

* begin development of a mobile application from scratch
  * **NOT** a responsive website viewed on a mobile device
  * must apply technologies taught up to and including DEV week, e.g.
    * Apache Cordova, React Native, &c.
    * combine technologies taught to fit your mobile app...
* can be platform agnostic (cross-platform) or specific targeted OS, e.g.
    * cross-platform app that builds for Android and iOS
    * targeted build for Android or iOS
    * consider choice, and explain why?
* outline concept, research conducted to date
* consider applicable design patterns
* are you using any sensors etc?
  * how, why?
* prototyping
  * demo current prototypes
  * any working tests or models etc
* anything else to help explain your mobile app...

**NB:** DEV week assessment will include the following:

* brief presentation or demonstration of current project work
  * ~ 10 minutes per group
  * analysis of work conducted so far
    * e.g. during semester & DEV week
  * presentation and demonstration...
    * outline mobile app
    * show prototypes and designs
    * explain what does & does not work
    * ...

<a id="assessment4"></a>

##### 4. final assessment (40%)

* continue to develop your app concept and prototypes
  * develop application using any of the technologies taught during the course
  * again, combine technologies to best fit your mobile app
* produce a working app
  * as far as possible try to create a fully working app
  * explain any parts of the app not working...
* explain choice of technologies for mobile app development
  * e.g. data stores, APIs, modules, &c.
* explain design decisions
  * outline what you chose and why?
  * what else did you consider, and then omit? (again, why?)
* which concepts could you abstract for easy porting to other platform/OS?
* describe patterns used in design of UI and interaction

  * 90% to 81%  = A-
  * 80% to 71%  = B+
  * 70% to 61%  = B
  * 60% to 51%  = B-
  * 50% to 41%  = C
  * 40% to 31%  = F
  * 30% to 0%   = ?
