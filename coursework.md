##### 2. DEV week assessment (30%)

* begin development of a mobile application
  * **NOT** a responsive website viewed on a mobile device
  * must apply technologies taught up to and including DEV week, e.g.
    * Apache Cordova, React Native, &c.
    * combine technologies taught to fit your mobile app...
* can be platform agnostic (cross-platform) or specific targeted OS, e.g.
    * cross-platform app that builds for Android and iOS
    * targeted build for Android or iOS
    * consider choice, and explain why?
* outline concept, research conducted to date
* consider applicable design patterns
* are you using any sensors etc?
  * how, why?
* prototyping
  * demo current prototypes
  * any working tests or models etc
* anything else to help explain your mobile app...

**NB:** DEV week assessment will include the following:

* brief presentation or demonstration of current project work
  * ~ 10 minutes per group
  * analysis of work conducted so far
    * e.g. during semester & DEV week
  * presentation and demonstration...
    * outline mobile app
    * show prototypes and designs
    * explain what does & does not work
    * ...

<a id="assessment3"></a>

##### 3. final assessment (40%)

* continue to develop your app concept and prototypes
  * develop application using any of the technologies taught during the course
  * again, combine technologies to best fit your mobile app
* if the app uses Apache Cordova
  * implement a custom Cordova plugin for a native mobile OS
    * e.g. Android or iOS
* produce a working app
  * as far as possible try to create a fully working app
  * explain any parts of the app not working...
* explain choice of technologies for mobile app development
  * e.g. data stores, APIs, modules, &c.
* explain design decisions
  * outline what you chose and why?
  * what else did you consider, and then omit? (again, why?)
* which concepts could you abstract for easy porting to other platform/OS?
* describe patterns used in design of UI and interaction

#### Important assessment dates

* DEV week demo
  * due Friday 20th October 2017 @ 2.45pm
* final project demo
  * due Friday 8th December 2016 @ 2.45pm
* final team report
  * due Friday 15th December 2017 @ 2.45pm

#### Grading

Grades will be issued for appropriate weekly or section tasks, where applicable, and for each of the core assessments listed above.
A composite grade will then be available at the end of the semester for the overall class.

Grades will use the following scale,

  * 100% to 91% = A
  * 90% to 81%  = A-
  * 80% to 71%  = B+
  * 70% to 61%  = B
  * 60% to 51%  = B-
  * 50% to 41%  = C
  * 40% to 31%  = F
  * 30% to 0%   = ?
