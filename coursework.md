* prototyping
  * demo current prototypes
  * any working tests or models etc

**NB:** DEV week assessment will include the following:

* brief presentation or demonstration of current project work
  * ~ 10 minutes per group
  * analysis of work conducted so far
    * eg: during semester & DEV week
  * presentation, demonstration, or video overview...

* produce a working app
  * as far as possible try to create a fully working app
  * explain any parts of the app not working...
* explain design decisions
  * outline what you chose and why?
  * what else did you consider, and then omit? (again, why?)
* which platform/s did you choose, and why?
* which concepts could you abstract for easy porting to other platform/OS?
* describe patterns used in design of UI and interaction

#### Important assessment dates

  * 90% to 81%  = A-
  * 80% to 71%  = B+
  * 70% to 61%  = B
  * 60% to 51%  = B-
  * 50% to 41%  = C
  * 40% to 31%  = F
  * 30% to 0%   = ?
